# Email-Spam-Detection

##  Project Overview
This project detects whether an email is **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)** using
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques.

The model is trained on a labeled email dataset and achieves high accuracy
using TF-IDF vectorization and Logistic Regression.



##  Technologies Used
  Python
  Pandas, NumPy
  Scikit-learn
  NLP (TF-IDF)
  Logistic Regression



##  Dataset
Publicly available Email Spam Text Classification Dataset  
Labels:
 0 → Ham (Not Spam)
 1 → Spam



##  Machine Learning Workflow
1. Data Cleaning
2. Label Encoding
3. Train-Test Split
4. Text Vectorization (TF-IDF)
5. Model Training
6. Evaluation


## Model Performance
 Accuracy: ~97%
 High precision & recall for spam detection
